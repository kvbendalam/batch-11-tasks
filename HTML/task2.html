    <h4>How to design a webpage</h4>
    <p>
        An engaging and informative website is essential for any business operating today. Designing a website may seem like an overwhelming project, but there are many tools available that can make creating your own site easy, even for beginners with no coding or design experience.

    <ul>
        <li>Web Hosting: Your website content requires physical space, and that is what web hosting platforms do—they store your texts, images and databases so that you can access them on the web.</li>
        <li>Domain Name: Your domain name is the address visitors see in their browser bar when they search for you. To avoid confusion, incorporate your name; and if it’s not available, choose something close to it. You can register your domain name with a domain registrar. Some hosting service providers also serve as domain registrars, so find out before purchasing.
        </li>
        <li>SSL Certificate: For your business’s security and reputation, and the safety of user information, obtain a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate from an SSL certificate service provider.</li>
        <li>Web Builder: Sign up on a website builder to create your website without coding experience. There are templates with features you can customize to design your choice website.</li>
    </ul>
